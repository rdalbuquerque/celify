	Use:   "celify",
	Short: "Validate yaml or json files using CEL expressions",
	Long: `celify is a CLI tool designed to validate structured data, supporting both JSON and YAML formats, against a defined set of Common Expression Language (CEL) rules.

	The tool aims to provide developers and operators with a flexible and concise way to enforce custom validation checks on their data, ensuring data consistency, correctness, and adherence to specified rules.
	
	Features:
	- Support for both JSON and YAML input formats.
	- Ability to define custom validation rules using CEL
	- Flexibility to provide input data and rules via files or raw strings.
	- Detailed error messages guiding users to the exact validation failure point.
	
	Examples:
	
	1. Validate a YAML file against a set of rules:
	   $ celify validate --target deployment.yaml --validations validations.yaml

	1. Validate a JSON file against a set of rules:
	   $ celify validate --target tfplan.json --validations validations.yaml
	
	2. Validate remote data:
	   $ celify validate --target "$(curl -s https://example.com/data.json)" --validations validations.yaml

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
